# Project Vault

A project management system using Obsidian with an atomic notes approach for clear, organized project tracking.

## System Overview

**Project Vault** is a project management system using Obsidian with an atomic notes approach. Key principles:

- Each note contains exactly one clear concept (atomic principle)
- Projects organize work through a centralized dashboard
- All content lives in a flat hierarchy in the `Notes/` folder
- Projects connect to their dependencies through bidirectional links
- The system uses tags rather than folders for organization

## Quick Links

- [[Project Vault Dashboard]] - Central hub for all projects
- [[AI-Instructions]] - Guidelines for AI assistant integration

## AI Integration

This system is designed to work seamlessly with AI assistants for enhanced project management:

- **Automated Project Creation** - AI can create complete project structures with all dependencies
- **Discovery Process** - AI guides users through structured questions to optimize projects before creation
- **Dependency Management** - AI ensures proper atomic note creation and bidirectional linking
- **Template Consistency** - AI maintains standardized formatting across all project files
- **Tag Optimization** - AI suggests appropriate category and meta tags for better organization

See `AI-Instructions.md` for detailed guidelines on how AI assistants interact with this system.

## File Structure

- **Notes/** - All content lives here in a flat structure
- **Dashboard** - Central overview of all projects
- **Project Files** - Main project hubs with goals and progress tracking
- **Dependencies** - Atomic notes supporting specific projects

## Organization System

### Tagging Structure
- **Meta tags**: Content-specific tags like `#exercise`, `#cooking`, etc.

### Dashboard Structure
- **Inbox** - Notes that need processing (**keep empty - process or remove items regularly**)
- **Active Projects** - Currently working on
- **Projects on Hold** - Temporarily paused  
- **Archived Projects** - Completed projects

## Key Principles

1. **Atomic Principle** - One concept per note
2. **Flat Hierarchy** - No folders, everything in `Notes/`
3. **Bidirectional Linking** - Dependencies link back to main projects
4. **Tag-Based Organization** - Use tags instead of folders
5. **Centralized Management** - Dashboard provides overview

This system transforms complex projects into manageable, interconnected atomic pieces while maintaining clear oversight through the centralized dashboard.
